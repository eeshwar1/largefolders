# largefolders.sh
Find large folders in any path
Internally uses du and tested on Kubuntu Linux and macOS.

Basically an slighly improved version of a solution I found on StackOverflow to find folder/directories that occupy a large amount of space on the system

## Usage: 
largefolders.sh path [[[-l levels]]"
